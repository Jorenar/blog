Have you heard such words? Well, I have. Countless of times, be it
in direct conversation or on a forum. The response is, as always, "it depends",
but in my humble opinion learning C is really valuable experience.

In this not too long text I hope to show you what I think makes C great.

### Spirit of C

Let's start with a quote from document [C99RationaleV5.10](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf):

> The C89 Committee kept as a major goal to preserve the traditional spiritof C.
> There are many facets of the spirit of C, but the essence is a community
> sentiment of the underlying principles upon which the C language is based.
> Some of the facets of the spirit of C can be summarized in phrases like:
>   * _Trust the programmer._
>   * _Donâ€™t prevent the programmer from doing what needs to be done._
>   * _Keep the language small and simple._
>   * _Provide only one way to do an operation._
>   * _Make it fast, even if it is not guaranteed to be portable._

Above points directly relate to what I will talk further in the article.

### "Mid-level"

In regards of level, there are two types of languages: low and high.

Low-level languages are close to the hardware, the only closer thing to CPU
would be electricity itself. Those languages are divided into machine code and
Assembly. The former is a stream of raw, usually binary, data. If somebody is
required to work with it, usually does it using more "readable" hexadecimal form.

Second-generation languages - Assembly - provide one abstraction level on top
of the machine code. Those languages are mostly only a mapping of human-readable
symbols, including symbolic addresses, to opcodes, addresses, numeric constants,
strings and so on. Also are different for each processor.

How do high-level languages, providing more abstraction, compare? Quoting Wikipedia:

> In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language
> elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant
> areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of
> developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a
> lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how
> "high-level" a programming language is.

In short: low = more machine friendly, high = more human friendly.

C is high-level, but back when it was created, most of the work was still being
done in low-level Assembly. As a result, C has lower level of abstraction than
other (still) widely used languages, hence I like to call it "mid-level".

You can also easily (with less language bloat) compile C code to Assembly
instead to binary and examine what instructions CPU will execute.

And if it there is a need, popular C compilers offers you the option in C level
down and use inline Assembly to squeeze everything out of CPU. Not really many
other languages implement such a thing.

### Fairly simple

Low-level languages are harder to program in. Not because they are more complicated,
but because they are more error prone and thus require way more commitment,
memorizing and fiddling.

C is mid-level, so "by definition" it's easier. But there comes the surprise,
learning it is easier compared to higher level languages. Why? Because of really
simple syntax and [structured paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming)
(don't confuse with `struct`!). It doesn't take so much to learn the basics.
Loops, functions, structures, pointers, variables, types - the core of language.
Intense week to get the general idea. The rest is "just" maths and CS theorem.

But, but, but, but! Don't get me wrong! To master anything you will
need a lot more practice! **A lot!** And it's truth for anything out there!

### Fast and lightweight

There is little of needless code in standard library. And what there is, believe me,
over the decades was really polished.

Maturity, emphasis on proper memory management, inline Assembly and to less
abstraction and little bloat, gives programmer really good control over the program.

This makes C an ideal choice for OS kernels (Linux, Windows NT or macOS's XNU to
name a few) or other languages (e.g. Python). That's also why C is so popular
on embedded systems, where you cannot afford to waste resources.

### Ubiquity = portability

Does there exist any (still) significant platform with no C compiler available?
Except for those which run only Assembly, I've never heard about one.
C programs are present on your high-end gaming PC, on NASA spacecrafts and
in ticket machines. Literally everywhere. C software runs the world.

In accordance to previous paragraphs, C is peculiarly strong choice for
microcontrollers and other forms of embedded systems, which surround us every day.

And have you heard about [FFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface)?
Turns out many other languages like to have some kind of compatibility with C.

You don't need to worry if you will be able to use this language somewhere as
for 99% you can! (Although it doesn't mean you should...) It means, that while
code may not be 100% portable, you will be a portable programmer.

### The influencer

C has both directly and indirectly influenced innumerous amount of languages.
C++, Java, Go, D, Rust, Perl, even PHP and Python - those are but few examples.

Obviously, knowledge of C isn't needed to learn any of them and sometimes
may even push you to use not the best practices.

Nevertheless, I think it's important to remember the roots. And if you are
cautious, familiarity with C might give you some foothold. It's especially the
case with C++.

### Rich collection of libraries

I suspect all this talk about fastness, lightness, mid-level, Assembly etc. might
have give you an idea, you will need to implement everything yourself. There may
be not any [`LinkedHashMap`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html)
like in Java or other or other functionality like garbage collector...
True, true, except...  not entirely.

C is mature and popular language. Name a thing and believe me, somebody somewhere
already created library for it (although if think about something too obscure,
you won't find it for all the world, but it does exists).

You want garbage collector? [Boehm GC](https://www.hboehm.info/gc/) has you covered.
TUI? Nothing like timeless [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/).
Examples can be listed almost infinitely:
[GTK](https://gtk.org/),
[PDCurses](https://pdcurses.org/),
[libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/),
[ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org/),
[Genann](https://codeplea.com/genann),
[libsoundio](http://libsound.io/),
[SDL](https://libsdl.org),
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html),
[getopt](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt.html),
[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/),
[inih](https://github.com/benhoyt/inih),
[GMP](https://gmplib.org/),
[cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON),
[MuPDF](https://mupdf.com/),
[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)...

It's very universal language - you can program basically anything: web server,
video game (e.g. [classics from _id Software_](https://github.com/id-Software)),
operating system, other programming language or wrapper forcing Firefox to obey
[XDG Base Directory specification](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory),
because when I'm an administrator, the programs will do exacly what I told them to!

However, please, remember - the fact you can, doesn't mean you should. For example,
if you want to create a video game, you really ought to turn your eyes to C++.
And you should know, that...

### C++ is highly backward compatible

Why do I even make the whole point out of C++ here? Because it's one of most
widely used languages today and you needing to encounter it is more than certain.
Particularly, as I've said, if you are interested in GameDev, as there C++
is **the** language.

In contrary to other languages embracing C compatibility, C++ was created as its
direct descendant and committee goes to great lengths to keep the "copy-paste"
compatibility with it - in most cases you can compile C code as C++ just fine.

Don't be mistaken, C++ isn't by any means a superset of C - the code isn't always
going to work with C++ and a good C code isn't necessary good C++ code. Consider example:
```c
int* x = malloc(10 * sizeof(*x));
```
Perfectly good in C, but in C++ there ought to be `(int*)` before `malloc()`,
for it to work, not to mention you should use `new int[10]` instead.

Although in most cases you can use C library safely in your C++ project.
All examples from the previous point not only **can be**, but **often are**
used in such way. E.g. I myself used _ncurses_ in my C++ code for hex editor
[Bym](https://joren.ga/bym/).

### A blot on the landscape...

C was created in year 1972 on the foundation of B language, so over the years
it acquired some quirks (`memcpy()` is defined in string header!), some things
became obsolete, some useless and are kept only for compatibility with old code.

A beginner is likely to burn a lot of time chasing down strange behavior caused
by memory corruption with no idea how to reason about, what may lead actually
big discouraged to programming in general.

[Undefined behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior) is the
term one needs to learn early on, because there is little to none mechanism to
prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot.

It's also important to take into account that C is not the introduction to
Computer Science. Learning none of languages is. You need to study it properly
to get a true understanding of this vast field. If not formal education in
university, then online one will be good too. The Internet is full of resources,
some can be found on my [list of URLs](https://joren.ga/urlsList/).

## Conclusion

Learning C is valuable experience and it's worth it. If not as your first
language, then as second, third, fourth or whatever. There are a lot of advantages,
but also some disadvantages. At least trying won't hurt. Give it a chance, who
knows, you may truly get to like it, just like me.

And don't believe people saying "C is dead" or "It will soon be replaced"
(I'm looking at you Rust fans). C is fine and will be relevant for few next decades too.
Heck! COBOL, nearly forgotten, yet there are still job openings! How is C supposed
to become obscure when, in the moment I write those words, there is planned new
standard revision (working name: C2x) with preview release from last month!
