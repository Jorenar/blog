_VLA_ is an acronym of **variable-length array**, which is an **array** (actual
array, not just block of memory which can act like one) that have size (at
least one dimension) determined during runtime (instead of at compile time).

<aside class="notice" markdown="1">
Languages supporting VLAs in one form or another include: Ada, Algol 68, APL,
C, C#, COBOL, Fortran, J and Object Pascal. As you may notice, beside C and C#,
those aren't languages one would call mainstream nowadays.
</aside>

VLAs were introduced with the revision C99 of the C standard.
At first glance they seem convenient and efficient, but it's just
an illusion. In reality they are just sources of constant issues.
Truly a stain on otherwise really good revision.

<aside class="notice" markdown="1">
As you could have guessed by the quote at the beginning, project which used to
rely on VLA quite extensively is nothing else than Linux kernel. Maintainers
spent a lot of effort to get rid of all VLA and as of version 4.20 (year 2018)
it's completely VLA-free.
</aside>

# Allocation on stack

VLAs are usually allocated on stack and this is the source of the most of the
problems. Let's consider a painfully simple, very favourable to VLA, example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    long double arr[n];
    printf("%Lf", arr[0]);
    return 0;
}
```

As we can see, it takes a number from user then makes array of that size. Compile
and try it. Check how big values you can input before getting segfault caused
by stack overflow. In my case, it was around half a million. With primitive type!
Imagine what would be the limit for structure! Or what if it wasn't just `main()`?
Maybe a recursive function? The limit shrinks tremendously.

And you don't have any (portable, standard) way to react after a stack
overflow - the program already crashed, you lost control. So you either need
to make elaborate checks before declaring an array or betting that user won't
input too large values (I think we can already guess the outcome of such gamble).

So the programmer **must** ensure that VLA size doesn't exceed some safe maximum,
but in reality, if you know safe maximum, there is rarely any reason for not using
it always.

## Worst of it is...

... that segfault is actually one of the best outcomes of improperly handled VLA.
The worst case is an exploitable vulnerability, where attacker may choose a value
that causes an array to overlap with other allocations, giving them control over
those values as well. A security nightmare.

<aside class="notice" markdown="1">
At the cost of further drop of efficiency, in GCC you can
enable `-fstack-clash-protection` option. It adds _extra_ instructions around
variable length stack memory allocations to probe each page of memory at
allocation time. This mitigates stack-clash attacks by ensuring all stack
memory allocations are valid or by throwing a segfault if they are not, thus
turning a possible code-execution attack into a denial of service.
</aside>

## So how to fix this example?

What if I need to let user define size and creating ridiculously large fixed
array would be too wasteful? It's simple - use `malloc()`!
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    long double* arr = malloc(n * sizeof(*arr));
    printf("%Lf", arr[0]);
    return 0;
}
```

In this case I was able to input over 1.3 **billion** on my machine before
segfault. Almost 2500 times larger size! But I still got the segfault, right?
Well, the difference is in possibility of checking the value returned by `malloc()`
and thus being able to, for example, inform the user about the error:
```c
    long double* arr = malloc(n * sizeof(*arr));
    if (arr == NULL) {
        perror("malloc()"); // output: "malloc(): Cannot allocate memory"
    }
```

<aside class="notice" markdown="1">
I've encountered a counterargument, that as C is often used as a systems/embedded
language, there are situations where using `malloc()` may not even be possible.

_\*Sigh\*_ I'm basically going to repeat myself here, but it is really important.

On such device you're not going to have a lot of stack either. So instead of
dynamically allocating on stack, you should determine how much you need and
just always use that fixed amount.

When using VLA on system with small amounts of stack, it's really easy to
make something which seems to work, but which blows your stack if your function
gets called from a deep call stack combined with the large amount of data.

If you always allocate fixed amounts of stack space everywhere, and you test it,
you know you're good. If you dynamically allocate on stack, you have to test all
your code paths with all the largest sizes of allocated space, which is much
harder and much easier to make a mistake. Don't make it even easier to shoot
yourself in the foot for no real advantage.

# Creation by accident

Doing something by mistake is major cause of bugs and the sole availability
makes it's easy to inadvertently create an VLA when not intended.
The following will silently create a VLA when it's clearly not necessary:
```c
const int n = 10;
int A[n];
```
Thankfully, any half-decent compiler would notice and optimize VLA away, but...
what if it doesn't notice? Or what if for some reason (safety?) the optimizations
were not turned on? But it surely isn't so much worse, right? Well...

# Slower than fixed size

Without compiler optimizations a function with [VLA from previous example](https://godbolt.org/z/fKn6nj8qG)
will result in **7 times** more Assembly instructions than its
[fixed size counterpart](https://godbolt.org/z/9qdPnbaod) before moving past
the array definition (look at the body before `jmp .L5`).
But it's without optimizations - with them the produced Assembly is exactly the same.

So [an example where VLA isn't by mistake](https://godbolt.org/z/T9Pcn471E):
```c
#include <stdio.h>
void bar(int*, int);

#if 1 // 1 for VLA, 0 for VLA-free

void foo(int n) {
    int A[n];
    for (int i = n; --i;) {
        scanf("%d", &A[i]);
    }
    bar(A, n);
}

#else

void foo(int n) {
    int A[1000];  // Let's make it bigger than 10! (or there won't be what to examine)
    for (int i = n; --i;) {
        scanf("%d", &A[i]);
    }
    bar(A, n);
}

#endif

int main(void) {
    foo(10);
    return 0;
}

void bar(int* B, int n) {
    for (int i = n; --i;) {
        printf("%d %d", i, B[i]);
    }
}
```
For our educational purposes in this example, `-O1` level of optimisation will
work best (as Assembly will be more clear and `-O2` won't help VLA's case here
really much).

When we compile VLA version, before instructions corresponding to `for` loop, we get:
```nasm
push    rbp
mov     rbp, rsp
push    r14
push    r13
push    r12
push    rbx
mov     r13d, edi
movsx   r12, edi       ; here VLA "starts"...
sal     r12, 2         ;
lea     rax, [r12+15]  ;
and     rax, -16       ;
sub     rsp, rax       ;
mov     r14, rsp       ; ... and there "ends"
```

VLA-free version on the other hand generates:
```nasm
push    r12
push    rbp
push    rbx
sub     rsp, 4000      ; this is caused by array definition
mov     r12d, edi
```

So not only fixed array spawns less code, but also way simpler code.
Why, VLA even causes more overhead at the beginning of the function.
It's not so much more in the grand scheme of things, but it still isn't
just a pointer bump.

But are those differences significant enough to care?
[Yes, they are](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=02361bc77888).

# No initialization

To add more to the issue with inadvertent VLA, the following isn't allowed:
```c
int n = 10;
int A[n] = { 0 };
```
Even with optimizations, initialisation isn't allowed for VLAs. So despite
wanting fixed size array and compiler being technically able to provide one,
it's won't work.

# Mess for compiler writers

Few months ago I saved a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/jz2213/are_vlas_bad_even_if_theyre_not_allocated_on_the/gdc3hz6)
on Reddit listing problems encountered with VLA from compiler writer perspective. I will cite it:

> * A VLA applies to a type, not an actual array. So you can create a `typedef`
>   of a VLA type, which "freezes" the value of the expression used, even if
>   elements of that expression change at the time the VLA type is applied
> * VLAs can occur inside blocks, and inside loops. This means allocating and
>   deallocating variable-sized data on the stack, and either screwing up all
>   the offsets, or needing to do things indirectly via pointers.
> * You can use `goto` into and out of blocks with active VLAs, with some things
>   restricted and some not, but the compiler needs to keep track of the mess.
> * VLAs can be used with multi-dimensional arrays.
> * VLAs can be used as pointer targets (so no allocation is done, but it still
>   needs to keep track of the variable size).
> * Some compilers allow VLAs inside structure definitions (I really have no idea
>   how that works, or at what point the VLA size is frozen, so that all instances
>   have the same VLA(s) sizes.)
> * A function can have dozens of VLAs active at any one time, with some being
>   created or destroyed at different times, or conditionally, or in loops.
> * `sizeof` needs to be specially implemented for VLAs, and all the necessary
>   info (for actual VLAs, VLA-types, and hybrid VLA/fixed-size types and
>   arrays and pointed-to VLAs).
> * 'VLA' is also the term used for multi-dimensional array parameters, where
>   the dimensions are passed by other parameters.
> * On Windows, with some compilers (GCC at least), declaring local arrays which
>   make the stack frame size over 4 KiB, mean calling a special allocator

And believe me, if you take a stroll around some C forums you will see even
more different complaints.

# Reduced portability

Due to all previously presented problems, some compiler providers decided to
not fully support C99. The primary example is Microsoft with its MSVC.
The C Standard's Committee also noticed the problem and with C11 revision
VLAs were made optional (many would prefer _deprecated_).

That means code using a VLA won't necessarily be compiled by a C11 compiler,
so you need to check whether it is supported with `__STDC_NO_VLA__` macro and
make version without VLA as fallback. Wait... if you need to implement VLA-free
version either way then what's the point of doubling the code and creating VLA
in the first place?!

<aside class="notice" markdown="1">
As a side note - C++ doesn't have VLA and nothing suggests it ever will.
Not a dealbreaker, but still point against VLA in C.  </aside>

Especially since VLAs are...

# ... kinda useful only in one case

There is one use case where VLA comes in handy: dynamically allocating
multi-dimensional arrays where the inner dimensions are not known until runtime.
It isn't even unsafe as there's no arbitrary stack allocation.

```c
int (* A)[m] = malloc(n * sizeof(*A)); // `n` and `m` are variables with dimensions
if (A) {
   // A[i][j] = ...;
   free(A);
}
```

The VLA-free alternatives are either:

* **piecemeal allocation with `malloc()`**
```c
int** A = malloc(n * sizeof(*A));
if (A) {
    for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        A[i] = malloc(m * sizeof(*A[i]));
    }
    // arr[i][j] = ...
    for (i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        free(A[i]);
    }
    free(A);
}
```

* **1D array with offsets**
```c
int* A = malloc(n * m * sizeof(*A));
if (A) {
    // arr[i*n + j] = ...
    free(arr);
}
```

* **big fixed array**
```c
int A[SAFE_SIZE][SAFE_SIZE]; // SAFE_SIZE must be safe for SAFE_SIZE*SAFE_SIZE
// A[i][j] = ...;
free(arr);
```

# Conclusion

I do hope I got most of the arguments against VLA. If there is even more
hidden problems with them...

<aside class="notice" markdown="1">
It's probably also worth mentioning that VLAs were supposed to be a solution
to even more problematic (non-standard) `alloca()`.
</aside>

In short, **avoid VLA**. It poses dangers without giving anything really useful
in return (beside in one situation). The only vla you endorse should be:
