C and C++ are two very interlaced, but still distinct languages. Believe it or
not, there were already tiny divergences even at the very birth of C++. Yet many
developers fall into the trap of thinking of C++ as a perfect superset over C,
what then leads to unpleasant surprise when something differs. Thus below I list
few online resources where one may learn a bit on the topic.
