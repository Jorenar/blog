Initially I wanted to write a full fledged text about the topic, but then I've found
a decade old article [Why the Second Generation of Video Game Consoles Is Really Two
Distinct and Separate Generations][1] by Rev.&nbsp;Robert&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Vinciguerra
on the archive of their blog [The&nbsp;Rev.&nbsp;Rob&nbsp;Times][2], which more or
less encapsulates what I've planned to say...

Therefore I'm limiting myself to short note with few links:
