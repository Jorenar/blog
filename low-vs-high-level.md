title:  "Know thy difference between low- and high-level in programming"

I have a pet peeve, I really do have a pet peeve. I've tried many times to let
it go, but to no avail. It really grinds my gears when somebody

>honestly not really understanding the difference between high level and low level languages

Well, let me demonstrate!  
20 first elements of Fibonacci sequence in C, Python, JavaScript, Nasm and Mips

#### High-level

**C**

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main()
    {
        int a = 1;
        int b = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) {
            { int c = b; b = a; a = c; }

            printf("%d\n", b);
            a += b;
        }
        return 0;
    }


**Python**

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-

    a = 1
    b = 1

    for i in range(0, 20):
        a,b = b,a

        print(str(b))
        a += b

**JavaScript**

    "use strict";
  
    let a = 1;
    let b = 1;

    for (let i = 0; i < 20; ++i) {
        [ a, b ] = [ b, a ]

        console.log(b);
        a += b;
    }

#### Low-level

**Nasm** (code from [here](https://github.com/luc99a/Assembly-Codes/blob/master/fibonacci.asm); without utilizing "external" routines)

    section .bss
    toprint:	resb	1

    section .data
    lf:	db 0Ah

    section .text
        global _start
    _start:
        mov eax, 1
        mov ebx, 1
        mov ecx, 20
    loop:
        add ebx, eax
        push eax
        push ebx
        push ecx
        call printnum
        pop ecx
        pop eax
        pop ebx
        dec ecx
        test ecx, ecx
        jnz loop
        mov eax, 1
        mov ebx, 0
        int 80h


    printnum:
        xor edi, edi
    divide:
        xor edx, edx
        mov ecx, 10
        div ecx
        push edx
        inc edi
        test eax, eax
        jnz divide
    print:
        pop eax
        add eax, '0'
        mov [toprint], eax
        mov ebx, 1
        mov ecx, toprint
        mov edx, 1
        mov eax, 4
        int 80h
        dec edi
        test edi, edi
        jnz print
        mov eax, 4
        mov ebx, 1
        mov ecx, lf
        mov edx, 1
        int 80h
        ret

**Mips** (code from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/ptc09c/comment/heu7k12/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3); utilizing "external" routines)

    main:   .text
            li  $t0, 1
            li  $t1, 1
            li  $a0, 1
            jal print

    loop:   jal print
            move    $t0, $t1
            move    $t1, $a0
            add     $a0, $t1, $t0
            blt $a0, 20, loop

    exit:   li  $v0, 10
            syscall

    print:  sw  $a0, 0($sp)
            li  $v0, 1
            syscall
            li  $a0, 10
            li  $v0, 11
            syscall
            lw  $a0, 0($sp)
            jr  $ra
